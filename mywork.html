	<h2> This is possibly my favorite photo edit ever. Kate Trabalka, an incredible Missourian photographer, went on quite a mission for these photos. I had to coordinate with my contact at the Blue Note for upgraded access. We chose 12 photos from 3 bands,
		which required hours of research, editing, toning, captioning, and writing. </h2>

	 <h2> This was an edit that fell outside my jurisdiction on the music and social justice beats. However, I was lucky to be on staff this day for a fun project! Josh Ellenburg, the photographer, found a local bee meeting he wanted to photograph.
		 While Josh did all of the grunt work on this one, I was fortunate to have experience raising bees in the past and be able to provide my own input. The final gallery of photos left me in the
		 photo lab for quite a late night, but it was all worth it.</h2>
